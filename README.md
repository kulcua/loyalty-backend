# Open Loyalty

Open Loyalty is a headless loyalty technology for visionaries and innovators who want to implement an effective loyalty program that cuts across multiple touchpoints. Our solution is 100% API-first and unlike old-fashioned, monolithic software, itâ€™s easy to integrate with and ensures complete flexibility, speed, and effectiveness at all levels.
